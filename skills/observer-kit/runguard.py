"""Run-exclusivity locks + local run ledgers for spending/mutating batch scripts.

Prevents a whole class of batch-job failures: a process nobody realizes is still
running gets a second start, the two double-spend or corrupt shared state, and a
panicked "cleanup" makes it worse. Two primitives:

  acquire_lock(scope) — PID lockfile per resource scope. A second process on the
                        same scope HARD-REFUSES while the first is alive (SystemExit).
                        Same-PID re-acquire is a no-op (re-entrant). A lock whose
                        PID is dead is stale and taken over silently — crash
                        recovery is "just re-run", never "clean up".
  ledger(scope, event, **fields) — append-only JSONL audit file per run:
                        what was attempted, what happened, what it cost.
                        Also the data feed for run_dashboard.py.

  throttle(resource, per_second) — CROSS-PROCESS rate limiter (POSIX flock).
                        Call it before every request to a shared API: all
                        concurrent runs on this machine collectively stay at
                        per_second, first-come-first-served. Lets you run
                        multiple datasets in parallel without multiplying the
                        request rate against one provider account.

Scopes are independent: a 'sourcing' run never blocks a 'crm-write' run.
Parallel datasets: parameterize the scope — acquire_lock(f'enrich-{table}') —
so the same table refuses twice while different tables run side by side.
Only do this when the datasets are PROVABLY disjoint (no shared records), and
throttle() every shared API. If the provider charges per result with a
per-record cap, remember: the in-flight ≤ need invariant only holds within one
process — overlapping datasets in two processes can double-spend.

State dir: $RUNGUARD_STATE_DIR, else ./.runguard next to this file. All
processes that should coordinate must use the SAME state dir.
Override for deliberate parallel use of one scope (rare): RUNGUARD_DISABLE=1.
