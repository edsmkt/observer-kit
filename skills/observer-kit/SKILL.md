  Guardrails and a live localhost dashboard for any script that spends API

  writing or running batch jobs, enrichment or scraping runs, or bulk record
  writes — including scripts the engineer already wrote. Adds crash-safe run
  locks (a second accidental run refuses to start, so nothing double-spends or
  corrupts data), cross-process rate limiting, an append-only audit ledger, and
  a read-only web view of what each run is doing in real time. Optionally: a
  plain-English EXPLAIN.md the operator can verify, and a sample-first loop with
  inline chat to steer before the full run.

# observer-kit

Take a batch script — one the engineer already wrote, or one you're about to
write — and make it **guarded and visible**: it can't collide with another run,
every action lands in an audit trail, and the operator watches it live in a
browser. Three stdlib-only files, zero dependencies.

## When to reach for this

The moment a script will:
- call a paid API in bulk (per-lookup credits),
- write in bulk to a CRM, database, or spreadsheet,
- or is one where two accidental concurrent runs would double-spend or corrupt data.

Wire it in **before** the code spends or writes — the guardrails only help if
they're in place first.

## Make an existing script show live + guarded (the core — 3 moves)

`runguard.py` and `run_dashboard.py` play different roles — treat them differently:
- **`runguard.py` is a library your script imports** → **vendor it** (copy it into
  the target project, next to the script). ~200 lines, stdlib-only.
- **`run_dashboard.py` is a standalone viewer** → **do NOT vendor it.** Run one
  instance, pointed at whatever project's ledger dir. One observer serves every project.

**First, agree the schema with the operator — propose, don't interrogate.** The
dashboard shows *exactly* the fields you log, so decide them together before wiring.
Read what the script does, **propose a sensible default**, and let them accept, edit,
add, or drop:

> "Here's what I'd surface — one row per **company**: `source · condition · supabase ·
> hubspot · status`, plus a **contacts** table (`name · title · tier · email`). Accept,
> or want columns added/removed?"

In the proposal, cover: **which entities/steps** (each becomes a `table` / sub-tab);
**where each row was pulled from and pushed to** (Supabase / HubSpot / Cloudflare /
CSV / webhook…), plus conditions and a status (each a column); and **any key fields**
they'll want to eyeball. Whatever they land on *is* your `record` schema — log those
field names verbatim. Re-propose whenever the pipeline changes.

Then add three things to the script that already exists:

**1. Lock it** — one line before the first spend/write:
```python
from runguard import acquire_lock, ledger
acquire_lock('my-scope')   # scope = the dataset's identity, e.g. f'enrich-{table}'
```
A second run on the same scope hard-refuses (SystemExit) while the first is
alive — nothing double-spends. Different scopes still run in parallel.

**2. Ledger it** — bracket the run, and log one `record` per unit of work, with the
fields the operator asked for:
```python
ledger('my-scope', 'run_started', description='what this run does')
for item in work:
    ...whatever the script already does...
    # field names below = exactly what they said they want to see
    ledger('my-scope', 'record', table='companies', key=item.id,
           company=item.domain, source='northdata',
           condition='met', supabase='inserted', hubspot='pushed', status='done')
ledger('my-scope', 'run_finished', processed=len(work))  # numeric fields become top-bar totals
```
The ledger is BOTH the audit trail and the dashboard's feed. `record` events are
the general path — the dashboard builds a table from whatever fields you log, no
column config. Group steps with `table=` (each becomes its own sub-tab:
companies → contacts → enriched); identify rows with `key=` (repeat a key to
update that row in place → renders `· was X`); every other field becomes a
column; booleans show ✓/—; the top counters are derived from the data.

**3. Watch it** — run the observer, pointed at that project's ledger dir (no
copying, no editing — just pass the dir):
```bash
python3 /path/to/observer-kit/run_dashboard.py <project>/.runguard   # http://localhost:8484
# or:  RUNGUARD_STATE_DIR=<project>/.runguard python3 run_dashboard.py
# add --port 8485 to observe a second project at the same time
```
Read-only — it tails the files and never touches a run. One instance can observe
any project; you don't vendor it per-project.

That's the whole core. The script now can't collide, has an audit trail, and
streams live — without changing what it actually does.

## Setup once per project (Claude Code): the run-started hook

So you don't have to *remember* to start the watcher, add a hook that reminds you
whenever a run begins. `runguard` prints an `OBSERVER_RUN_STARTED <run_id>` marker on
every `run_started`; the bundled `observer_hook.py` catches it and tells you to start
that run's watcher. **On setup, add this to the project's `.claude/settings.json`**
(merge with existing hooks — don't replace):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
          "if": "Bash(python3 *)",
          "command": "python3 ~/.claude/skills/observer-kit/observer_hook.py" } ] } ]
  }
}
```

Keep it **specific so it never touches unrelated work**:
- **Install it project-local** (`.claude/settings.local.json` in the repo that runs
  observer-kit), NOT global — a global hook would run on every Bash in every project.
- The **`if: "Bash(python3 *)"`** guard means it only even executes on `python3 …`
  launches — `git`, `ls`, etc. never trigger it. (Adjust the pattern if your runs launch
  another way, e.g. `Bash(./run.sh *)`.)
- Even when it runs, it is **silent unless** the output contains the very specific
  `OBSERVER_RUN_STARTED runguard:<file>` marker — so it never injects into unrelated
  commands. Silent hooks are invisible in the UI.

(Use the vendored path if the kit isn't user-installed, e.g. `python3 tools/observer-kit/observer_hook.py`.)
When a run starts, the hook nudges you to run `watch_chat.py <run_id>` — the run-scoped
watcher, so notes reach the right session. It's a **backstop**: reliable for foreground
launches; a background launch's marker may not be in the immediate tool output, so still
start the watcher yourself when you launch in the background.

## Optional add-ons (reach for the ones that fit)

- **Throttle a shared API** — `throttle('<provider>', <per_second>)` before each
  call, so several parallel runs share ONE rate budget (limits are per account).
- **State intent up front (`EXPLAIN.md`)** — write a plain-English + one-ASCII-diagram
  file in the state dir describing what the run will do and won't. The dashboard's
  "How it works" tab renders it so a non-technical operator can verify before any
  spend. Regenerate it when the pipeline changes. Template bundled.
- **Sample-first — for anything that spends credits.** Run a small sample, call
  `wait_for_feedback(run_id)` (it blocks while the operator reviews the sample in
  the dashboard and leaves notes on specific cells), adjust the script, re-sample,
  then run the full list. Iterations show before/after (`· was X`). Reply and
  resolve notes with `post_chat(run_id, anchor, text, resolved=True)` (badge → ✓).
  A running process can't change its own code, so all real iteration happens on
  the sample; the full run polls `read_chat()` between rounds only for a STOP.
- **Hear the operator while you're idle — start a RUN-SCOPED watcher (key for many
  sessions).** After launching a run, set up a watcher so the operator's dashboard
  notes reach you. Use the bundled `watch_chat.py <run_id>`: it prints new notes for
  that one run and exits, so your harness re-invokes you with them. Get the id from
  `runguard.current_run_id(scope)` (e.g. `runguard:2025-06-15-enrich.jsonl`).
  - In **Claude Code**, point the Monitor tool at `python3 watch_chat.py <run_id>`.
  - Otherwise, loop it (or poll `read_chat(run_id)` yourself).

  **Scope it to YOUR run_id.** All notes land in one shared `chat.jsonl`; with several
  sessions open, an *unscoped* watcher wakes every session on every note. A run-scoped
  watcher routes each note to only the session that launched that run — session A never
  wakes for a note left on session B's run.
- **Continuous vs separate lanes** — same scope name = one continuous run
  (before/after and chat persist across re-runs). Set `RUNGUARD_SESSION=<slug>`
  to open a separate lane (a dated weekly run, or a clean A/B).

## Safety rules (do not skip)

- A lock refusal is the guard working, not an error to bypass. Stop the named
  PID deliberately; never launch a parallel run to "fix" a stuck one.
- Design so there is no cleanup step: write results to the durable store as they
  land, and resume by re-reading what's still missing. A crash then costs
  nothing and re-running is always safe.
- Put a hard spend ceiling in code, and never re-buy a record whose outcome is
  already logged.

- `README.md` — the full pattern and the `record` convention.
- `BUILD-GUIDE.md` — rebuild the whole stack from scratch, with acceptance tests.
- `example_worker.py` — runnable end-to-end example; run two copies to watch the
  lock refuse the second.
- `sample-ledger.jsonl` — demo data; the dashboard renders it with no run needed.
