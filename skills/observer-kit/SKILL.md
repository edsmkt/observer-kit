  Guardrails and a live localhost dashboard for any script that spends API

  writing or running batch jobs, enrichment or scraping runs, or bulk record
  writes. Adds crash-safe run locks (a second accidental run refuses to start,
  so nothing double-spends or corrupts data), cross-process rate limiting, an
  append-only audit ledger, a plain-English EXPLAIN.md the operator can verify,
  and a read-only web view of what each run is doing in real time. Run a small
  sample first and let the operator steer via inline chat on the results before
  the full run.

# observer-kit

Wire safety and visibility into any script that **spends money or changes shared
state**, and give the operator a live window into every run.

## When to reach for this

Use it the moment you are about to write or run:
- a batch / enrichment / scraping job that calls a paid API (per-lookup credits),
- a bulk write to a CRM, database, or spreadsheet,
- anything where two accidental concurrent runs would double-spend or corrupt data.

Do it **before** the code spends or writes — the guardrails only help if they
are in place first.

## What to do

The kit is three stdlib-only files in this skill directory. Copy the ones you
need into the target project (vendor them; don't import from the skill dir):

1. **`runguard.py`** — the guard. In every script that spends or mutates:
   - `acquire_lock('<scope>')` before the first spend/write. Derive the scope
     from the dataset's identity (`f'enrich-{table}'`) so the same dataset
     refuses to run twice, while different datasets run in parallel.
   - `ledger('<scope>', 'run_started', description='...')`, one event per
     meaningful outcome, then `'run_finished'`. These events feed the dashboard.
   - `throttle('<provider>', <per_second>)` before every call to a shared API,
     so parallel runs share one rate budget (rate limits are per account).
   - If a shared client library performs the writes, call `acquire_lock` INSIDE
     its mutating method (gate on HTTP verb, exempt reads) — then every future
     script inherits the guard for free.

2. **`run_dashboard.py`** — the observer (a SAMPLE; adapt it). Point its
   `SOURCES` at the project's ledger directory, run `python3 run_dashboard.py`,
   open http://localhost:8484. Remap `humanize()` and the table columns to the
   events this workflow logs. It is read-only — it never touches a run.

3. **`EXPLAIN.md`** — WRITE THIS for the project, in the state dir, **before**
   the run spends anything. Plain English + one ASCII flow diagram of what THIS
   pipeline does: where the work list comes from, which providers it calls, the
   per-record cap, what it writes, and what it will NOT do. The dashboard's
   "How it works" tab renders it live so a non-technical operator can confirm
   the run is doing the right thing and stop it if not. Regenerate it whenever
   the pipeline changes — stale intent is worse than none. Use the bundled
   `EXPLAIN.md` as the template.

## The sample-first loop (MANDATORY)

Never run a full list first. Always:
1. Run a small **sample** (e.g. 5 items) with the guards on, logging to the ledger.
2. Call `runguard.wait_for_feedback(run_id)` — it **blocks** so the operator can
   review the sample in the dashboard and leave notes on specific columns/cells.
3. Read the notes, adjust the script/workflow, and run another sample if needed.
   Code changes always mean a **new run** — a running process can't change its own
   code — so re-running is how an adjustment takes effect.
4. Only once the sample looks right, run the full list. The full run polls
   `read_chat()` between rounds for a **STOP** signal (the one thing it can act on
   live); everything else is iterated on the sample, not mid-run.

Iterations show as **before/after** in the dashboard — a changed cell renders
"· was X" — so the operator sees exactly what your adjustment changed.

**Continuous by source (default):** name the scope for the dataset
(`f'enrich-{table}'`), and every run over that source appends to ONE continuous
run — same table, before/after across iterations, chat notes + ✓ persisting. Use
`current_run_id(scope)` for the matching chat id. Set `RUNGUARD_SESSION=<slug>`
only to open a SEPARATE lane (a dated slug for a fresh weekly run, or a unique
label for a clean A/B).

**Redo specific rows (agent handles this):** the "never re-buy" guard skips rows
whose outcome is already recorded. To redo rows on request — e.g. an operator note
on a cell, whose anchor names the exact row + column — clear just those rows'
value/outcome in the durable store, then re-run the sample. Only the reset rows
re-process (and re-charge); everything else is untouched. Never disable the global
guard to force a redo — reset the specific rows.

## Receiving operator feedback (inline chat)

The operator leaves notes anchored to a column or cell in the dashboard. They
arrive as a file-drop inbox you **pull** (there is no push into a running agent):
- `runguard.read_chat(run_id, author='user')` — notes waiting for you.
- `runguard.wait_for_feedback(run_id)` — block until new notes arrive (use after a sample).
- `runguard.post_chat(run_id, anchor, text)` — reply; shows in that cell's thread.
- `runguard.post_chat(run_id, anchor, text, resolved=True)` — mark a note handled;
  the cell's badge flips to a green ✓.

Address every note and resolve it, so the operator watches the loop close.

## Safety rules (do not skip)

- A lock refusal is the guard working, not an error to bypass. Stop the named
  PID deliberately; never launch a parallel run to "fix" a stuck one.
- Design so there is no cleanup step: write results to the durable store as they
  land, and resume by re-reading what is still missing. A crash then costs
  nothing and re-running is always safe.
- Put a hard spend ceiling in code, defaulting to the plan's worst-case need.
- Never submit more work for one entity than its remaining need (in-flight ≤
  need ⇒ worst-case spend = the cap), and never re-buy a record whose outcome
  is already recorded.

## Deeper reference (in this directory)

- `README.md` — the full pattern, event vocabulary, parallel-datasets + throttle.
- `BUILD-GUIDE.md` — rebuild the whole stack from scratch, with acceptance tests.
- `example_worker.py` — runnable end-to-end example (parallel datasets + shared
  throttle). Run two copies to watch the lock refuse the second.
- `sample-ledger.jsonl` — demo data; the dashboard renders it with no run needed.
