## System Boundaries

Observer Kit is a local workflow harness with five pieces:

1. **The agent skill** carries the operational judgment: map the real workflow,
   design the operator view, run a sample, inspect evidence, and request approval.
2. **The CLI** repeats setup and transport: `init`, `dashboard`, `run`, `watch`,
   `reply`, `doctor`, and `test`.
3. **`runguard.py`** gives scripts source locks, append-only events, counters,
   checkpoints, validation, policy gates, write intents and receipts, controls,
   dead letters, simulation, and shared throttling.
4. **`run_dashboard.py`** tails a state directory and renders every JSONL lane.
   It also records operator chat and control requests.
5. **`watch_chat.py`** carries dashboard messages into the active agent harness.

The agent session remains the brain. The watcher supplies input, and the script
acknowledges controls at its own durable boundaries.

## Source Identity And Run Lanes

Pass the real input identity as `source=`. Good identities remain stable across
retries and distinguish genuinely separate datasets:

- a resolved CSV, JSONL, workbook, or export path;
- a Google Sheet ID plus worksheet identity;
- a database table plus stable query or snapshot ID;
- an API export ID, object collection, or remote dataset version.

`start_observed_run(name, source=...)` derives the lock scope from the workflow
name and source identity. Two processes using the same identity contend on one
lock. Disjoint source identities can run concurrently.

Capture reviewed input state with `input_snapshot()`:

```python
from runguard import input_snapshot, start_observed_run

snapshot = input_snapshot(args.input)
run = start_observed_run(
    'transform-records',
    source=args.input,
    input_snapshot=snapshot,
    destination='warehouse',
    transform_version='v3',
    script=__file__,
    dry_run=args.dry_run,
)
```

File sources receive a content hash automatically. Remote sources gain a useful
fingerprint when `records=` or `version=` accompanies their identity. A changed
fingerprint in the same lane emits `input_changed` for operator review.

Choose lanes by intent:

- **Retry, script fix, or additional enrichment of existing rows**: reuse the
  source, session, table, and stable keys. New record events update those rows.
- **Clean comparison, redo, or separate batch**: set a new stable
  `RUNGUARD_SESSION`, pass `--session <name>`, or use `--session auto`.

## Minimal Wrapper

Use `start_observed_run()` for new scripts and adapted scripts that fit the
standard lifecycle:

```python
from runguard import RunPaused, start_observed_run

run = start_observed_run(
    'normalize-catalog',
    source=args.input,
    dry_run=args.dry_run,
    description='Normalize catalog records and append accepted rows',
    todo=len(records),
    progress_table='records',
    summary_metrics=[
        {'key': 'processed', 'label': 'processed'},
        {'key': 'accepted', 'label': 'accepted'},
        {'key': 'written', 'label': 'written'},
    ],
)

try:
    for record in records:
        run.check_controls()
        with run.step('normalize', table='records', key=record['id'],
                      source_value=record['value']):
            output = normalize(record)
            persist_checkpoint(record['id'], output)
            run.count('processed')
            run.checkpoint('last_record', record['id'])
        run.check_controls(after_record=True)
    run.success()
except RunPaused:
    raise
except Exception as exc:
    run.fail(exc)
    raise
```

`run.step()` writes the same row as `running`, then `done` or `failed`. A failed
step includes `error` and creates a replayable dead letter. `run.success()` and
`run.fail()` write terminal events and release the source lock. Process exit
before either closure writes `run_abandoned`.

Use the lower-level `acquire_lock()` and `ledger()` functions when the script
needs a custom lifecycle while preserving the same source, row, durability, and
approval contracts.

## Operator View And Record Identity

The dashboard is generic. Design tables from the user's entities rather than
from Observer Kit's examples.

Every business row uses:

```python
ledger(scope, 'record', table='orders', key=order_id,
       source='erp', amount=amount, qualification=reasoning,
       warehouse='pending', error='')
```

- `table` groups comparable entities.
- `key` identifies one entity across retries and later enrichment.
- arbitrary fields become columns.
- the first meaningful identity field becomes the frozen inspection column.
- a non-empty `error` field places the current row in Attention.
- a later event with the same `table` and `key` updates the row in place and
  retains fields supplied by earlier events.

`run.step(name, **fields)` reserves `name` for the step label. Use `label` or
`entity_name` for a business name during the step, then emit the operator-facing
`name` field in the completed record or receipt update.

Represent source processing and destination delivery as separate fields. For
example, `status='transformed'` describes local work and
`warehouse='appended'` describes the confirmed sink outcome. Emit the confirmed
outcome on the same business row so `pending` changes to `appended`, `updated`,
`inserted`, `skipped`, or `failed` in one column.

Choose three to five `summary_metrics` that answer the operator's main questions.
Emit additional counters for audit value while keeping the headline strip
compact.

## Durable Boundaries And Resume

A **durable boundary** is the point where completed work can be read after the
process exits. Suitable boundaries include:

- an appended JSONL checkpoint row;
- a committed database transaction;
- a confirmed Sheet or CRM update;
- a cache file written atomically;
- a provider result stored with its stable source key.

Use this completion order for each item or bounded chunk:

1. Perform the provider, transformation, or source work.
2. Persist its authoritative result.
3. Emit the dashboard record for the same stable key.
4. Emit the checkpoint that resume will read.
5. Begin the next spend or mutation.

Resume starts by reading the durable store, derives the remaining work, and
reuses the same lane and keys:

```python
saved = read_checkpoint_rows(checkpoint_path)
remaining = [row for row in source_rows if row['id'] not in saved]

for row in remaining:
    result = paid_provider(row)
    append_checkpoint(row['id'], result)
    ledger(scope, 'record', table='records', key=row['id'], **result)
    run.checkpoint('last_record', row['id'])
```

For a phase-batched pipeline, persist every finalized item as a phase completes.
When an API returns authoritative batches, persist each bounded response before
submitting the next batch. Progress events provide liveness; the saved result
provides durability.

Run `references/lint_emit.py` against every agent-written batch script. It checks
for final record flushes and for result containers that advance while the script
offers progress events in place of a durable sink. Treat its zero exit as one
piece of evidence and confirm the real sink during the sample.

## External Delivery

Wrap every CRM, database, spreadsheet, file, webhook, or API mutation in an
observed delivery boundary:

```python
CONTRACT = {
    'required': ['id', 'name'],
    'types': {'id': 'string', 'name': 'string'},
    'unique': ['id'],
}
POLICY = {
    'allowed_destinations': ['warehouse'],
    'protected_fields': ['created_at'],
}

for row in rows:
    output = transform(row)
    run.validate(output, row['id'], CONTRACT, table='records')
    allowed = run.allow_write(
        output, row['id'], POLICY, current=row, destination='warehouse')
    if allowed:
        ticket = run.write_intent(
            row['id'], 'warehouse', payload=output,
            record_table='records')
        if run.dry_run:
            continue
        if ticket:
            result = upsert_warehouse(
                output, idempotency_key=ticket['operation_key'])
            run.write_receipt(
                ticket,
                destination_id=result['id'],
                verified=True,
                record_table='records',
                outcome_field='warehouse',
                outcome='updated',
                lineage={'source': 'input_export'},
            )
    run.check_controls(after_record=True)
```

`run.write_intent()` creates a stable operation key from the record key,
destination, and transform version. Pass that key to destination idempotency
support. `run.write_receipt()` records confirmed delivery and can update the
business row's destination field. `run.reconcile()` summarizes intended,
written, verified, pending, skipped, blocked, and dead-lettered operations.

A prior intent with a confirmed receipt returns an idempotent skip. A prior
intent awaiting a receipt raises `PendingWrite`, giving the agent a clear
reconciliation task: inspect the destination, then record the matching receipt
or retry according to destination evidence.

Use `run.lineage()` or receipt `lineage=` for source URL, provider, reasoning,
model, or transformation provenance. Keep sensitive payloads in their governed
store and place hashes or `payload_ref` values in the ledger.

## Live Loops, Batches, And Pools

Emit from the place where work becomes authoritative.

For a sequential loop, persist and emit per item:

```python
for row in rows:
    with run.step('transform', table='records', key=row['id']):
        output = transform(row)
        append_checkpoint(row['id'], output)
        run.count('processed')
        run.checkpoint('last_record', row['id'])
```

For a thread or process pool, persist and emit as futures complete:

```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=workers) as pool:
    futures = {pool.submit(enrich_one, row): row for row in rows}
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        row = futures[future]
        result = future.result()
        append_checkpoint(row['id'], result)
        ledger(scope, 'record', table='records', key=row['id'], **result)
        run.count('processed')
        run.checkpoint('last_record', row['id'])
```

For provider batches, emit a `batches` row or progress event before submission,
persist the response after completion, then update that same batch row. Keep
stdout and stderr unbuffered with `python3 -u`, `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`, or
`flush=True` so logs and ledger timing agree.

## Controls, Chat, And Watchers

The dashboard writes controls to `controls.jsonl` and operator messages to
`chat.jsonl`. Both channels retain the run ID and relevant anchor.

Call `run.check_controls()` before starting the next item and
`run.check_controls(after_record=True)` after a durable item boundary:

- `pause` closes the attempt at the next check and emits `run_paused`.
- `stop_after_record` waits for the next `after_record=True` check.
- `approve_full_run` is returned to the script or harness as an operator signal.

Each applied control emits `control_acknowledged`, so recovered processes retain
one-shot control state.

Use one long-lived dashboard and one all-run watcher for a project:

```bash
observer-kit dashboard .runguard
observer-kit watch .runguard --all --follow
```

`observer-kit run` also detects `OBSERVER_RUN_STARTED` and starts a run-scoped
watcher. The watcher emits `OBSERVER_CHAT_EVENT` lines to the active harness.
The harness inspects evidence, edits scripts, resumes work, and replies:

```bash
observer-kit reply .runguard \
  --run runguard:my-run.jsonl \
  --anchor run \
  --resolved \
  --text "Updated the transform and resumed from the saved checkpoint."
```

## Failure And Recovery

Close expected failures through `run.fail(exc)` and preserve the original
exception. `run.step()` creates an error-bearing row and dead letter for item
exceptions. Use `run.dead_letter()` directly for recoverable failures discovered
outside a step.

`run.replay_candidates()` returns unresolved record failures after a fix. Emit
the repaired record with the same table and key; set `error=''` with the current
healthy fields so Attention reflects the latest row.

Recovery follows evidence:

- source lock present: wait for the named process or deliberately stop it;
- process exit: rerun with the same source and lane;
- pending external intent: inspect the destination and complete reconciliation;
- input fingerprint change: review the new input and choose update-in-place or a
  separate lane;
- schema or policy event: fix the source, transform, contract, or policy and
  replay the affected keys;
- quality gate pause: review the measured batch and resume after the threshold
  or workflow rule is intentionally updated.

## Parallel Sources, Throttling, And Ceilings

Use one source-derived lock for each dataset identity. Parallel runs earn their
separate scopes when the datasets are provably disjoint. Shared destinations
gain idempotent operation keys, and shared provider accounts gain one throttle
resource name:

```python
throttle('provider-account:production', 5)
response = provider_call(payload)
```

`throttle()` coordinates local processes through an advisory file lock. Every
process using the same resource string shares the configured request rate.

Encode a hard maximum for spend, successful paid results, messages, writes, and
deletes. For providers that charge per result, submit work bounded by each
entity's remaining need and check already-saved outcomes before submission.

## Dashboard Event Contract

The dashboard renders arbitrary JSON fields. These events receive first-class
behavior:

| Event | Important fields | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `run_started` | `description`, `todo`, `progress_table`, `summary_metrics` | open an attempt |
| `run_manifest` | source snapshot, destination, versions, hashes | establish provenance |
| `record` | `table`, `key`, arbitrary columns, optional `error` | create or update a row |
| `metric` | `metric`, `value`, `increment` | update counters |
| `checkpoint` | `checkpoint`, `value` | show durable progress |
| `credits` | `provider`, `used`, `left` | show provider spend separately |
| `write_intent` | operation key, record key, destination | reserve delivery |
| `write_receipt` | operation key, destination ID, status | confirm delivery |
| `dead_letter` | record key, error, retry, payload reference | target recovery |
| `control_acknowledged` | control ID, kind, note | confirm worker action |
| `run_paused` | reason | close a paused attempt |
| `run_finished` | status, counters, checkpoints | close success |
| `run_failed` / `run_abandoned` | `error`, counters, checkpoints | close failure |

The JSONL ledger remains append-only. The dashboard folds `record` events by
attempt, dry/live mode, table, and key to present the latest row while retaining
the event history for timeline inspection. Fresh clients fetch large ledgers in
chunks and immediately continue until caught up.

## Production Verification

Prove the harness against real workflow behavior before the full dataset:

1. Run `observer-kit doctor .` and the emit/durability linter.
2. Start the dashboard before a representative dry-run sample.
3. Compare dashboard rows and counters with the raw JSONL.
4. Compare each completed sample row with its durable result store.
5. Force a failure after several saved items and resume the same lane.
6. Start a second process on the same source and confirm lock refusal.
7. Exercise pause or stop and confirm worker acknowledgement at a boundary.
8. Reconcile external intents and receipts with destination state.
9. Verify later enrichment updates the same rows and a comparison session opens
   a separate dashboard view.
10. Present writes, skips, errors, schema findings, spend, ceilings, and restart
    evidence for explicit approval.
