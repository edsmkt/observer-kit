# Observer Install Matrix

Observer has two distribution surfaces:

- **Agent skills**: the playbooks that tell an agent how to design, review,
  pause, fix, and resume data work.
- **CLI/runtime helpers**: the local plumbing that initializes a project,
  launches the dashboard, runs commands, watches dashboard messages, and writes
  the same JSONL ledger.

The skills are the source of truth for operator behavior. The CLI should make
that behavior repeatable, not define a separate workflow.

## Supported Paths

| Path | Command | Use when | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global skills | `npx skills add edsmkt/observer-kit -g` | You want Observer available to agents in every local project. | Installs the Observer Kit and Observer Flow playbooks. The agent still probes for the CLI before setup. |
| Project skills | `npx skills add edsmkt/observer-kit` | You want Observer available only in the current project. | Same playbooks, scoped to the project. Useful for teams that vendor skills with a repo. |
| CLI from GitHub | `python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/edsmkt/observer-kit.git` | You want the normal `observer-kit` command without cloning this repo. | Provides `observer-kit init`, `dashboard`, `run`, `watch`, `reply`, `doctor`, and `test`. |
| Editable checkout | `python3 -m pip install -e .` | You are developing Observer itself or testing local changes. | Provides the same CLI from this checkout. `python3 -m observer_kit --help` should also work. |
| Skill-only bundled helpers | Agent copies `runguard.py`, `watch_chat.py`, `run_dashboard.py`, and `EXPLAIN.md` from the installed skill. | Package installation is unavailable or the user chooses a vendored setup. | Produces the same local ledger, controls, dashboard, and watcher semantics as the CLI path. |

## Compatibility Contract

All install paths should agree on these observable behaviors:

- The dashboard reads append-only JSONL events from the selected state
  directory.
- `record` events use `table` and `key` as the stable row identity, and later
  events for the same pair update the existing row.
- A run emits liveness evidence while work happens and persists durable progress
  before advancing past a completed item or bounded chunk.
- Controls are cooperative: Pause and Stop are acknowledged at script
  checkpoints; the dashboard does not kill the worker process.
- Watchers are transport only. They carry dashboard messages to the active
  agent session, while the agent decides how to inspect, fix, resume, or ask for
  full-run approval.
- Full runs require explicit operator approval after a bounded dry-run sample.

When changing runtime behavior, update the skill playbooks first or in the same
change. When changing the playbooks, keep the CLI examples and bundled helpers
aligned with the same contract.

## Source Of Truth

The canonical execution contract lives in:

- [`skills/observer-kit/SKILL.md`](../skills/observer-kit/SKILL.md)
- [`skills/observer-kit/references/pattern.md`](../skills/observer-kit/references/pattern.md)
- [`skills/observer-flow/SKILL.md`](../skills/observer-flow/SKILL.md)
- [`skills/observer-flow/references/flow-contract.md`](../skills/observer-flow/references/flow-contract.md)

The README is the product overview and quick start. This matrix documents the
supported distribution paths. Runtime code should stay small and defer
operator-facing decisions to the playbooks.

## Ledger Size And Long Runs

The ledger is append-only JSONL by design. That keeps crashes recoverable and
makes live review simple, but it also means long backfills can create large
files.

Current guidance:

- Emit business-row updates at useful review boundaries, not every internal
  retry or polling tick.
- Persist authoritative results in a durable store and use the ledger as the
  live audit/review stream, not as the only database for a long-running job.
- For million-row backfills, split work into bounded chunks or lanes with
  stable source identities so each run remains inspectable.
- Keep raw provider responses only for bounded samples or explicit debug cases;
  project fields into normal columns for the full run.

Future runtime work may add paging, archive helpers, or compaction for completed
runs. Until then, design long jobs around bounded runs and durable external
state.

## Security Boundary

Observer is a visibility and review harness, not a sandbox. The CLI runs the
command passed after `--`, and the skills assume the active agent can edit and
resume that workflow. Keep the dashboard bound to `127.0.0.1`, avoid exposing
state directories publicly, and treat project scripts with the same trust level
as any other local automation that can spend credits or mutate data.
