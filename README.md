# observer-kit

Guardrails and a live localhost dashboard for any script that **spends API
credits** or **mutates shared state** (CRM, database, spreadsheets) — packaged
as an installable [agent skill](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

It gives batch / enrichment / scraping scripts three things, all stdlib-only,
no dependencies:

- **Run locks** — a second accidental run refuses to start, so nothing
  double-spends or corrupts data. Crash-safe: recovery is "just re-run", never a
  manual cleanup.
- **An audit ledger + cross-process rate limiting** — every submission, result,
  and credit recorded; parallel runs share one rate budget per provider.
- **A read-only web dashboard** (`http://localhost:8484`) — a live per-record
  table, a plain-English timeline, a run-info tab, and a **"How it works"** tab
  that renders a plain-English + ASCII `EXPLAIN.md` so a non-technical operator
  can verify what a run is doing and stop it if it's wrong.

## What it looks like

**Data** — one row per item; columns are whatever the run logs, and pills fill in live as results land:

**Timeline** — every step in plain English, newest work as it happens:

**How it works** — a plain-English + ASCII "statement of intent" (from
`EXPLAIN.md`) the operator reads to confirm what a run will do *before* it spends:

**Collaborate on a sample** — click any column header or cell to chat with the
agent, anchored to that exact spot. The intended loop: the agent runs a small
sample, you leave notes on what to change, it replies and marks them ✓, and the
next run shows **before/after** inline (`· was X`) so you see what changed —
before committing the full (expensive) run.

## Any workflow, any columns

The dashboard is **not** hardcoded to contacts/phones/emails. Log a generic
`record` event and the **Data** tab builds a table whose columns are exactly the
fields you logged — for *any* pipeline:

```python
runguard.ledger('my-run', 'record', table='companies',
                key=domain, company=domain, contacts=len(people),
                top_tier=1, sources='blitz,ai_ark', linkedin=True)
```

- **`table`** groups records into separate **sub-tabs** — a multi-step workflow
  emits a different shape at each step (e.g. `companies` → `contacts` → `enriched`),
  each its own table, so a later step's rows don't bury an earlier one's.
- **`key`** is the row identity — repeat it to update a row in place; a changed
  value renders `· was X` (before/after).
- Every other field becomes a **column**, in first-seen order. Booleans show ✓/—.
  The top counters are **derived from the data** (row count per table + boolean
  coverage), not hardcoded metrics.
- Table UX applies everywhere: first column frozen on horizontal scroll, sticky
  header on vertical scroll, drag a header edge to resize, double-click a cell to
  expand long values, click any cell/header to chat.

The bundled contact-enrichment view (phones/emails/CRM pills) is just the *example*
renderer that kicks in for `phone_found`/`email_found` events — remove it or ignore
it; `record` events are the general path.

## Install

Into your user scope (available in every project you open):

```bash
npx skills add edsmkt/observer-kit -g
```

Or into a single project's `./.claude/skills/`:

```bash
npx skills add edsmkt/observer-kit
```

Then, in any project, ask your agent to "wire in observer-kit" — or it will
reach for the skill on its own when it's about to write a credit-spending or
state-mutating batch script.

## Try it in 30 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edsmkt/observer-kit
cd observer-kit/skills/observer-kit
python3 run_dashboard.py          # open http://localhost:8484, pick the sample run
python3 example_worker.py --table alpha   # watch a run fill the table live
python3 example_worker.py --table alpha   # a second copy REFUSES — the guard working
```
